This project explores **time series forecasting** techniques applied to **cryptocurrency market data**, aiming to identify trends, visualize patterns, and predict future prices. Through the use of Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`, this notebook walks through the complete analysis pipeline—from data preprocessing to forecasting using time series models.

## 🧠 Overview

Cryptocurrencies are volatile and data-rich assets, making them ideal candidates for time series modeling. This project:

- Analyzes historical cryptocurrency price trends
- Visualizes daily price movements
- Applies decomposition and smoothing techniques
- Builds and evaluates forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA)
- Forecasts future price movements

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Data preprocessing & cleaning
- 📊 Trend and seasonality analysis using decomposition
- 🔍 Rolling statistics and stationarity tests (ADF)
- 🔧 ARIMA modeling for price forecasting
- 📉 Time-based visualizations using `matplotlib` & `seaborn`
- 📈 Future price predictions based on historical data
